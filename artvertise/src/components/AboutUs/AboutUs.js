      <h1>Our History</h1>
      <p>
        In 2010, two friends started an online art ecommerce business featuring contemporary art from emerging and established artists worldwide. They sourced artwork directly from the artists and leveraged social media to promote their business. By 2013, they hired additional staff and expanded their offerings to include limited edition prints and custom framing options.
        They launched a mobile app in 2016, opened a physical gallery space in 2018, and expanded their selection to include sculpture, ceramics, and photography. Today, the business continues to grow and thrive, remaining committed to promoting emerging artists and providing personalized service to their customers.
